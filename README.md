# U-net model for cells auto-segmentation
Original code:
This segmentation code was used here for Epidermal Cells auto-segmentation from Cuticles micrographs of **_Ginkgo biloba_** and **fossil ginkgoaleans**, **followed** the open-source code of U-Net and FCN (**Long et al. 2015ï¼› Ronneberger et al. 2015**). 

Requirements
--
Please see the file named _Requirements_ in the repository. It shows the running environments and hardware needed.

Folders
--
There are several folders for particular aims:	
_Folder code_ for all the codes used in the whole process of segmentation, and also for the training model named _unet.hdf5_, which would be generated by the code after training. The training model 

_Folder data_ for storing original images of cuticles and their labels for further deformation.	

_Folder deform_ for storing images and label after elastic-deformation, which comprise the training set.	

_Folder npydata_ for storing npy files generated during the model-training.	

_Folder test_ for images waited for segmentation, files' name should be started as 0.	

_Folder results_ for storing predictions results.

### Before start this project
To guarantee all running environments are set in your computer and your hardware meets the requirement.
Download our model file named _unet.hdf5_ in Supplementary files of our study, or generate your own model file by your own training set. The model file should be placed in the _Folder code_.
### Image pre-processing
The images should be cropped into 256x256 pi and transformed into 8-bit grayscale images.
One epidermal micrograph of 1388x1040 pi, for example, a cuticle graph of _Ginkgo biloba_ in 100 magnification under an optical microscope, is supposed to be cropped into 20 pieces of 256x256 pi images. The code named 256_spliting_by_opencv.py in _Folder code_ were used in our case.
Note: The images for segmentation should be placed in the _Folder test_.
### Run the code
in this order:
data.py <br />
unet.py<br />
see.py (in the _Folder code_)<br />
see.m (in the _Folder results_).<br />
You would see the results of prediction map shown in the _Folder results_.
